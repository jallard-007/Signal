# Signal

WIP

A compiler for my custom language

Uses CMake as a build tool and Catch2 for testing

TODO:
- Extensive testing of Parser and Checker

Potential future tasks:
- Parser error recovery. Currently, simply fails after a single syntax error (only 1 error reported at a time). So allow for all (or at least more) syntax errors to be reported.
